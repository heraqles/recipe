# Recipe App Angular 4

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0.

####Best way to run application:

* `npm install`
* `npm start` (run ng serve and json-server)

I was creating this app more/less 11 hours. I wanted to finish
most of the requirements and a few my ideas.

Time would be shorter - more/less 4 hours without: 
* server nad mockup, Http (using arrays to mockup)
* css styling
* possibility to manage (adding, deleting) lists of ingredients or cooking methods - list component
* routing
* properly file structure

Adding ingredients is possible when You create new recipe. Recipe details doesn't have edition.

Some of files needs refactoring and better usuage of typescipt possibilities
